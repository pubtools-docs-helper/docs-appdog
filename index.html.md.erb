The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Application Watchdog tile stores metrics data from applications running on PCF and graphically presents that data for operators and developers. PCF Application Watchdog helps operators and developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of the following data:

* Container metrics: CPU, memory, and disk percentages (updated every 30 seconds)
* Network metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency (updated every second)
* App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash (updated as they happen)

## <a id='install'></a>Installing PCF Application Watchdog

### <a id='pre-reqs'></a>Prerequisites

Ensure that you have installed the [Elastic Runtime Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The default <strong>Loggregator Port</strong> in Elastic Runtime is 443. In an AWS environment, the port must be changed to 4443.</p> 
  
### <a id='step1'></a> Step 1: Add the PCF Application Watchdog Tile to Ops Manager
   <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: PCF Application Watchdog should be installed on the same network as the Elastic Runtime Tile. </p>

1. Download the PCF Application Watchdog file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics).
1. Upload the PCF Application Watchdog file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Application Watchdog to your **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id='step2'></a>Step 2: Configure the PCF Application Watchdog Tile

From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Application Watchdog** tile.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The tile appears orange when it requires configuration.</p>

#### Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Application Watchdog jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Application Watchdog jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Ingestor Options

1. Click **Push Ingestor**.
1. Review the **Instance Count** value. The PCF Application Watchdog tile deploys one instance of the ingestor by default. You can increase this instance count at any time to accomodate higher levels of inbound log traffic. 
1. Click **Save**.

#### Errands

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Review the **Pre-Delete Errands**. If you deselect the **Cleanup** checkbox, artifacts may remain after the PCF Application Watchdog tile uninstalls.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The PCF Application Watchdog tile selects all <strong>Post-Deploy Errands</strong>, by default. Do not deselect any of these checkboxes.</p>

#### Resource Config

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job. If you expect a high level of use, you may need to increase the disk resources available to your instances.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Stemcell

1. Navigate to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click **Stemcells**.
1. Download the appropriate stemcell version for your IaaS.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> On AWS make sure to use a HVM stemcell if you are using the default instance sizes.</p>
1. Click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded.

### <a id='step3'></a>Step 3: Deploy PCF Application Watchdog

Click **Apply Changes** to install the service. Review the [Using PCF Application Watchdog](using.html) topic for more information on how to log in, use, and interpret data from PCF Application Watchdog.
