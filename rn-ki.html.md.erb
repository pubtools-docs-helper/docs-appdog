## Version 1.1.0
**Release Date: August 1st, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.1.0 introduces a new look and a new capability to search and filter up to 24hrs of your application logs. See the [Using PCF Metrics](./using.html) topic for more info.
* PCF Metrics 1.1.0 uses stemcell 3232

## Known Issues
* Due to a stemcell upgrade issue in earlier versions of Ops Manager, you must be on Ops Manager 1.7.8 or later to upgrade to PCF Metrics 1.1
* Due to a known limitation with deep pagination in Elastic Search, if the results of your log query exceed 10k, we are capping the result set that returns to the UI at 10k and disabling the needle navigation interaction. We are working to overcome this issue in the next version of the product. In the meantime, if you are impacted by the 10k result cap on your logs data, you can do the following to ensure more targeted queries:
	* reduce your viewed timeslice to an hour or a minute
	* use the available search filters
	* potentially change the timestamp filter from newest to oldest
* On the Explore view, when using the needle navigation interaction on the metrics graphs to jump to a particular point in time of your application logs, you may occasionally see the needle snap to a slightly different time stamp than the time selected. This can occur when there are fewer log lines available for the chosen time, and the needle instead snaps to a nearby time. If you experience this issue, we suggest that you scroll within the logs view to the desired time, at which point you should also see the needle move itself to the same time stamp. 
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment.

## Version 1.0.10
**Release Date: July 15, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.0.10 - BUG FIX: Corrects issue in 1.0.9 where the UI errand was not properly bumped to CLI v6.19, causing UI push to fail in some environments.

### Known issues
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 
* All v1.0.x tiles - if you see apps dropdown grayed out
    * Because of an earlier CLI bug, we have seen PCF metrics apps missing system org guid during tile upgrade/uninstall process which crashes PCF Metrics UI and makes the apps dropdown inaccessible. This is fixed in 1.1 Metrics tile. A work around for this to remove the user's access to system org using CLI.
* All v1.0.x tiles - if you don't see some apps in the dropdown even though they are accessible in apps manager
    * If you have apps manager/console admin privilege, you may be able to see apps in apps manager without having space developer role privilege to the spaces in which those apps reside. Metrics however follows permissions directly form cloud controller so if you have cloud.controller.admin privilege, you can see all apps in all spaces in all orgs in PCF Metrics UI. If you have space developer privilege to certain spaces then you can only see the apps in those spaces in PCF Metrics UI.  
* All v1.0.x tiles - SSO authentication is not supported. This feature is added in the 1.1 Metrics tile.

## Version 1.0.9
**Release Date: July 1, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.0.9 - now with stemcell 3232.12. Release also bumps required CLI to CLI v6.19.

### Known issues
* BUG IDENTIFIED: An errand was missed when requiring the CLI v6.19 bump, leaving the UI push errand still on v6.18.1. This bug has caused the UI push to fail in some environments. Metrics v1.0.10 corrects. 
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 

## Version 1.0.8
**Release Date: June 23, 2016**

### Notes
* This release fixes a route issue in prior versions of PCF Metrics v1.0 where you could receive a "404 Not Found: Requested route does not exist in PCF Metrics" error.

### Known issues
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 
* No direct upgrade path. Operators can delete the installed tile and install the new tile.  This does result in downtime and data loss.

## Version 1.0.4

### Notes
* Update to use Stemcell 3146.11
* Change list of apps available to a user and prevent overload of Cloud Controller API
* The route for the PCF Metrics application is registered as `metrics.<system-domain>` in this v1.0.4 release.   The application can be accessed at `https://metrics.<system-domain>`
* The install will create a small deployment suitable for hundreds of apps. This is not configured for thousands of apps.

### Known Issues
* Route mappings for `metrics.<system_domain>` and `metrics.<system_domain>/v2` may be overwritten or incorrectly mapped during redeploys.
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 
* No direct upgrade path. Operators can delete the installed tile and install the new tile.  This does result in downtime and data loss.

## Version 1.0.3

### Known issues
* Not all applications metrics are accessible to admin users.
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment.

### Notes
* Updated to use stemcell 3146.5
